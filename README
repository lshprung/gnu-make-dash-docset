Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a GNU Make docset for Dash.

- GNU Make: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash
- dash-docset-generation-template: https://github.com/lshprung/dash-docset-generation-template

To generate a docset from the latest edition of the GNU Make Manual, simply
execute `make` from the same directory as this README file. The latest edition
will be downloaded from www.gnu.org and packaged appropriately.

If you would prefer a docset without CSS, this can be specified by running `make NO_CSS=yes`.
Otherwise, a local CSS file will also be downloaded from www.gnu.org and included in the docset.

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl    - https://curl.se/
- make    - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- pup     - https://github.com/ericchiang/pup
- sqlite3 - https://www.sqlite.org/index.html
